/**
 * EXERCISE 3: Recursion
 *
 * SUMMARY:
 * Create a recursive function to determine if a number is even or odd,
 * based on the following definition:
 * - Zero is even
 * - One is odd
 * - For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2
 *
 * This demonstrates recursion as an alternative to the modulo operator (%)
 * for determining number evenness.
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * isEven(n):
 * - Uses recursion to verify if a positive whole number is even
 * - Parameters: a single positive whole number (n)
 * - Return: true if the number is even, false if it's odd or invalid
 * - The function must use recursion to call itself for this exercise
 *
 * TEST CASES:
 * - isEven(0) returns true
 * - isEven(1) returns false
 * - isEven(50) returns true
 * - isEven(75) returns false
 * - Note: isEven(-1) causes infinite recursion (a limitation!)
 *
 * LEARNING GOALS:
 * - Understanding recursion and base cases
 * - Recursive thinking and breaking problems into smaller instances
 * - Function parameters and return values
 * - Recognizing stack overflow problems with negative inputs
 * - Understanding the limits of recursive solutions\n */
