/**
 * EXERCISE 3: Bean Counting
 * 
 * SUMMARY:
 * Create two functions to count specific characters in a string.
 * - countBs: counts how many uppercase 'B' characters are in a string
 * - countChar: a more general function that counts any specified character
 * Then rewrite countBs to use countChar internally.
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * 
 * countBs(string):
 * - Parameters: a string
 * - Return: the number of uppercase 'B' characters in the string
 * - Use string indexing with [index] to access each character
 * - Use a loop to iterate through all positions (0 to string.length - 1)
 * - Increment a counter when 'B' is found
 * 
 * countChar(string, char):
 * - Parameters: a string and a character to search for
 * - Return: the number of times that character appears in the string
 * - Similar logic to countBs but searches for the specified character
 * - Should be reusable for counting any character
 * 
 * LEARNING GOALS:
 * - String indexing and iteration
 * - Using .length property to determine string bounds
 * - Conditional statements within loops
 * - Function parameters and return values
 * - Code reusability (using countChar in countBs)\n */\n\nexport function countBs(str) {
