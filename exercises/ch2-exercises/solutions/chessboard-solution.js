/**
 * EXERCISE 3: Chessboard
 * 
 * SUMMARY:
 * Create an 8×8 chessboard pattern using spaces and "#" characters.
 * The pattern alternates between spaces and hashes on each row,
 * with the alternation also shifting between rows to create the classic checkerboard effect.
 * 
 * EXPECTED OUTPUT (8×8):
 *  # # # #
 * # # # # 
 *  # # # #
 * # # # # 
 *  # # # #
 * # # # # 
 *  # # # #
 * # # # # 
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Build a string with newline characters ("\n") separating each row
 * - Use nested loops: outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns
 * - Print a space or "#" based on whether (row + column) is even or odd
 * - Use the modulo operator (%) to determine even/odd
 * - Accept a SIZE constant to make the chessboard any size
 * - Output the final string with a single console.log() call
 * 
 * LEARNING GOALS:
 * - Nested loops for 2D patterns
 * - String building with concatenation
 * - Using modulo (%) for alternating patterns
 * - Working with newline characters
 * - Loop variable coordination in multi-dimensional problems
