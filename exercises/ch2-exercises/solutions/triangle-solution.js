/**
 * EXERCISE 1: Looping a Triangle
 *
 * SUMMARY:
 * Write a loop that outputs a triangle pattern using the "#" character.
 * The triangle should grow from 1 hash to 7 hashes, with each level on a new line.
 *
 * EXPECTED OUTPUT:
 * #
 * ##
 * ###
 * ####
 * #####
 * ######
 * #######
 *
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Use a single for or while loop that calls console.log() 7 times
 * - Build a string that grows by one "#" character each iteration
 * - Use string concatenation or the += operator to add characters
 * - Use the .length property to track string growth (optional but useful)
 *
 * LEARNING GOALS:
 * - Understanding loops and loop control
 * - String concatenation and manipulation
 * - Understanding string properties (.length)
 * - Building patterns with loops and strings
