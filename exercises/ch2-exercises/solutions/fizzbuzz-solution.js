/**
 * EXERCISE 2: FizzBuzz
 * 
 * SUMMARY:
 * Print all numbers from 1 to 100 with special replacements:
 * - Print "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3
 * - Print "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3)
 * - Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5
 * - Print the number itself for all other cases
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * - Use console.log() to output each value
 * - Use looping (for or while) to iterate through numbers 1-100
 * - Use the remainder operator (%) to check divisibility
 * - Handle the three conditions: divisible by 3 only, 5 only, and both
 * 
 * LEARNING GOALS:
 * - Understanding loops (for/while)
 * - Using conditional statements (if/else if/else)
 * - Using the modulo operator (%) for divisibility checks
 * - Logical operators (&&, ||) for compound conditions
